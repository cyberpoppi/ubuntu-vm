<h1>Title: First Linux VM + Nmap Scan</h1><br>
<h2>Date: Aug 27, 2025</h2><br>

<br><h3>What I Did:</h3><br>

<br> • Installed Ubuntu in VirtualBox (2 CPU, 4GB (4096MB) RAM, 30GB disk (Dynamic))<br>

    <br><p>https://www.virtualbox.org</p><br>

<br>• Downloaded Linux ISO (Ubuntu)<br>
     <ul>
      <li>https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop</li>
      <li>Set up username</li>
      <li>Set up password</li>
     </ul>
<br>

• Installed Nmap<br>

    <ul>
     <li>sudo apt update</li>
     <li>sudo apt install nmap wireshark</li>
    </ul><br>
    
• Scanned my own VM<br>

  <ul>
   <li>Opened a terminal</li>
   <li>entered: ip addr</li>
   <li>Installed Nmap on main computer (Windows):  https://nmap.org/download.html
</li><br>
   <li>Ran: <pre><code></code>nmap 127.0.0.1</pre>
</li>
  </ul><br>
   
  
• Installed DVWA inside VM<br>

<ul>
 <li> sudo apt update</li>

  
   <li>sudo apt install docker.io</li>

   <li><pre><code>sudo docker run -it -p 8080:80 vulnerables/web-dvwa</code></pre></li>

    <li>Opened browser in VM</li>
</ul>

<ul>
 <li>http://localhost:8080</li>
 <li>Automatic login: admin/password</li>
 <li>Created new database</li>
</ul>
    
    
<br>What Happened:<br>

<p>• Output for Nmap scan showed 2 open ports (631/ipp, 8080/http-proxy) as well as 998 closed tcp ports. I did not at first fully understand all the results yet, but I learned that the Nmap shows which "doors" are open on a machine.</p> 

<p>I also learned that Port 631 is the Internet Printing Protocol. I didn't know that was even running by default. Next, I'll try a version scan with nmap -sV to learn more about what's behind that port. I further learned that Port 8080/http-proxy is commonly used for web servers or proxies and was almost certainly from when I started up DVWA inside Docker.
</p><br>
<p>• Nmap scan report showed: Host is up (0.000057s latency). I learned that means my VM is alive and responding on the network and that's how fast the machine responded.
</p><br>
<br>Next Step:<br>

• Try scanning ]nmap-sV to run a version scan and see service versions and research what that means. <br>
• Try scanning nmap -p- <IP> to run a full port scan and research what that means.<br>
• Look up vulnerabilities and document once I know the versions.<br>
• Try a new section on DVWA (ie. SQL Injection, XSS or Brute Force) possibly with a beginner walkthrough
