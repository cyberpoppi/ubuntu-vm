Title: First Linux VM + Nmap Scan
Date: Aug 27, 2025

What I Did:

 • Installed Ubuntu in VirtualBox (2 CPU, 4GB (4096MB) RAM, 30GB disk (Dynamic))

     https://www.virtualbox.org

• Downloaded Linux ISO (Ubuntu)

     https://ubuntu.com/downloa/desktop
     Set up username 
     Set up password

• Installed Nmap 

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install nmap wireshark

• Scanned my own VM

   Opened a terminal
   entered: ip addr
   Installed Nmap on main computer (Windows):  https://nmap.org/download.html

   Ran: nmap 127.0.0.1

• Installed DVWA inside VM

   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install docker.io

   sudo docker run -it -p 8080:80 vulnerables/web-dvwa

  Opened browser in VM

    http://localhost:8080
    Automatic login: admin/password
    Created new database

What Happened:

• Output for Nmap scan showed 2 open ports (631/ipp, 8080/http-proxy) as well as 998 closed tcp ports. I did not at first fully understand all the results yet, but I learned that the Nmap shows which "doors" are open on a machine. 

I also learned that Port 631 is the Internet Printing Protocol. I didn't know that was even running by default. Next, I'll try a version scan with nmap -sV to learn more about what's behind that port. I further learned that Port 8080/http-proxy is commonly used for web servers or proxies and was almost certainly from when I started up DVWA inside Docker.

• Nmap scan report showed: Host is up (0.000057s latency). I learned that means my VM is alive and responding on the network and that's how fast the machine responded.

Next Step:

• Try scanning ]nmap-sV to run a version scan and see service versions and research what that means. 
• Try scanning nmap -p- <IP> to run a full port scan and research what that means.
• Look up vulnerabilities and document once I know the versions.
• Try a new section on DVWA (ie. SQL Injection, XSS or Brute Force) possibly with a beginner walkthrough
